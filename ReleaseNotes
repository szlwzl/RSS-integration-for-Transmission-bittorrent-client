_Release 2_
DONE - Init parameters into a config file to allow for easier commit to git - http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html#ConfigParser.ConfigParser

_Release 1_
Everything works ok but there are much better ways of doing it


_RoadMap_
Processing of the description - this is a dictionary - no need for all the splits
Error Catching
Manual addition of torrents - no need to log them but still want to convert etc
Twitter Integration - DM on download
Choice of conversion - iphone/ipad/appleTV/android etc
Storage of Data in something other than MySQL - but what though?? Maybe a config file like above?
GUI for adding/editing/deleting torrents http://pythoncard.sourceforge.net/index.html http://www.ferg.org/thinking_in_tkinter/
